# pipeline-containerization
Configure, run and test bioinformatic pipelines in a container environment

### What is a container?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

### Working hypothesis
Configuring bioinformatics pipelines to run in containers provides portability and scalability to the software system.

### Road map
1. Research: Containers vs Virtual Machines, Containers vs Java Virtual Machine, Docker vs Singularity, strengths and weaknesses, use cases
1. Select target pipeline for project, run and get familiar with IO
1. Collate test data set
1. Run (non-containerized) pipeline test data set on 2 or more different machines
1. Compare output, run time, resource use, etc
1. Configure pipeline to run in container, including scripts for set up and management
1. Run containerized pipeline on the same machines
1. Compare output, run time, resource use, etc
1. Run containerized pipeline in the cloud
1. Compare output, run time, resource use, etc
1. Chart and report comparisons
