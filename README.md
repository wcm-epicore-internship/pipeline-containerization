# pipeline-containerization
Configure, run and test bioinformatic pipelines in a container environment

### What is a container?
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another.

### Working hypothesis
Configuring bioinformatics pipelines to run in containers provides portability and scalability to the software system.
